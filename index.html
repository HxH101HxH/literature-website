                    <strong>literature,</strong> a body of written works. The name has traditionally been applied to those
                     imaginative works of poetry and prose distinguished by the intentions of their authors and the perceived
                     aesthetic excellence of their execution. Literature may be classifiedaccording to a 
                     variety of systems, including <small> language, national origin, historical period, genre, and subject matter. 
                     For historical treatment of various literatures within geographical regions.</small> Some literatures are 
                     treated separately by language, by nation, or by special subject (e.g., Arabic literature, 
                     Celtic literature, Latin literature, French literature, Japanese literature, and biblical literature).

                <p>
                    Literature is a form of human expression. But not everything expressed in words—even when organized and 
                    written down—is counted as literature. Those writings that are primarily informative—technical, scholarly, 
                    journalistic—would be excluded from the rank of literature by most, though not all, critics. Certain forms 
                    of writing, however, are universally regarded as belonging to literature as an art. Individual attempts 
                    within these forms are said to succeed if they possess something called artistic merit and to fail if they 
                    do not. The nature of artistic merit is less easy to define than to recognize. The writer need not even 
                    pursue it to attain it. On the contrary, 
                    a scientific exposition might be of great literary value and a pedestrian poem of none at all.
