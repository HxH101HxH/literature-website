                <p>
                    Literature can be classified into different forms or types. Each form shares 
                    organizational characteristics and conventions. Several commonly recognized 
                    different types of literature are:

                <h3>STORY</h3>
                <p>
                    A story or narrative is a connected series of events told through words (written 
                    or spoken), imagery (still and moving), body language, performance, music, or any 
                    other form of communication. You can tell a story about anything, and the events 
                    described can be real or imaginary; covering both fiction and nonfiction; and 
                    leaving no topic, genre, or style untouched. There are stories about all things 
                    and all times; past, present and future. Whenever you are telling somebody about 
                    a series of events, you are telling a story, no matter what the subject nor when 
                    they occurred. As such, stories are of great value to human culture, and are some 
                    of the oldest, most important parts of life. <br>
                    Aside from being a part of every single type of literature, stories are at the 
                    foundation of creativity and part of just about everything we do, particularly when 
                    it comes to entertainment, recording, and reporting of any form. So, they are shared 
                    in all different ways—from oral and written storytelling or journalism; to TV, film, 
                    and radio; to fine arts, stage performance and music; and so on.

                <h3>PLAY</h3>
                <p>
                    A play is a literary work written for the theater that dramatizes events through the 
                    performance of dialogue and stage directions. The authors of plays, called playwrights, 
                    structure the performances into acts and scenes, which help build the tension and present 
                    the story in a compelling way for audiences. There are a few types of plays, such as those 
                    written for the stage, for radio (radio plays), and for television or motion pictures 
                    (screenplays). <br> <br> Plays are typically divided into two main genres: dramas, which 
                    are serious in tone and often tragic, and comedies, which are lighthearted and funny. All 
                    plays, however, aim to entertain and share meaningful insights into this human experience. 
                    Even when plays are more experimental or absurdist in nature, they speak to emotional truths 
                    and inspire critical thought. <br> 
                    The word play, meaning a dramatic performance, <br> originates from the early fourteenth 
                    century, with roots in the Greek paizo, meaning “to act.”

                <h3>POETRY</h3>
                <p>
                    Poetry is a type of literature based on the interplay of words and rhythm. It often employs 
                    rhyme and meter (a set of rules governing the number and arrangement of syllables in each 
                    line). In poetry, words are strung together to form sounds, images, and ideas that might be 
                    too complex or abstract to describe directly. <br> <br> Poetry was once written according to 
                    fairly strict rules of meter and rhyme, and each culture had its own rules. For example, 
                    Anglo-Saxon poets had their own rhyme schemes and meters, while Greek poets and Arabic poets 
                    had others. Although these classical forms are still widely used today, modern poets frequently 
                    do away with rules altogether – their poems generally do not rhyme, and do not fit any particular 
                    meter. These poems, however, still have a rhythmic quality and seek to create beauty through 
                    their words.
