                        <div class="card-text">
                            Charles Dickens was an extraordinary man. He is best known as a novelist but he 
                            was very much more than that. He was as prominent in his other pursuits but they 
                            were not areas of life where we can still see him today. We see him as the author 
                            of such classics as Oliver Twist, David Copperfield, Great Expectations, A Tale of 
                            Two Cities, Bleak House and many others. All of his novels are English classics. <br>
                            Dickens had an almost unbelievable level of energy. In addition to writing all those 
                            lengthy books in long-hand, he had time to pursue what would have been full-time careers 
                            for most people in acting, literary editing social campaigning and philanthropic administration. 
                            He was also the father of a large family, as well as being involved in a love affair that lasted many years.

                        <h4 class="card-title"> Emily Dickinson (1830-1886) </h4>
                        <div class="card-text">
                            Unknown as a poet during her lifetime, Emily Dickinson is now regarded by many as one 
                            of the most powerful voices of American culture. Her poetry has inspired many other 
                            writers, including the Brontes. In 1994 the critic, Harold Bloom, listed her among the 
                            twenty-six central writers of Western civilisation. <br> After she died her sister found 
                            the almost two thousand poems the poet had written. As her poems entered the public consciousness 
                            her reception concentrated on her eccentric, reclusive nature, but since then she has become 
                            acknowledged as an original and powerful poet. It is fortunate that her sister gained access 
                            to the poems as without them American culture would have been very much poorer. <br> <br> <br>

                        <h4 class="card-title"> Dante (Durante degli Alighieri) (1265-1321)</h4>
                        <div class="card-text">
                            Dante was an Italian poet. His most famous and acclaimed poem is the long narrative, The Divine Comedy, 
                            the story of the narratorâ€™s journey through hell and purgatory to paradise. It impacts on modern life 
                            in that its picture of what hell is like, with its ice and sulphurous fire, where sinners are tortured 
                            in the most horrific way, is the image Western culture has of hell. It is the picture of eternal torture 
                            that was painted by the Catholic Church for centuries. <br> Similarly, his purgatory and paradise have become 
                            the fixed image of what those places are like and, in fact, have until recently been taught by some religions 
                            as though they were real rather than fictional places. In some Christian sects they are still taught as the 
                            places invented by Dante.
